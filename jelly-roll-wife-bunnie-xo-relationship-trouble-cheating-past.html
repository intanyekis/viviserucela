The pair is known for their raw and unabashed honesty when it comes to their relationship, often overly generous when it comes to the details surrounding their whirlwind romance. Just like any rollercoaster, though, with everything climb in their relationship has come a series of falls in the form of controversy surrounding the couple. From cheating and divorce rumors to break-ups and make-ups, it's a wonder how the couple maintain such a strong bond to this day.</p><p>Regardless of the adversity the couple has faced, their marriage has been regarded as goals for many fans. Somehow, they've become the blueprint to many of their fans for what unconditional love truly is. It seems nothing that has come their way could deter the pair from sticking it through together. So what's their secret? How does a country star who used to live out of a van make it work with a former Vegas escort-turned-podcaster? Let's look into the Jelly Roll and Bunnie Xo's journey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> Is There A Link Between Country Star Jimmie Allen’s Divorce And Those Assault Allegations?</a></span></p><h2 id=how-jelly-roll-met-his-wife-bunnie-xo>How Jelly Roll Met His Wife, Bunnie Xo</h2><p>Jelly Roll and Bunnie Xo have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the most shocking "how they met" stories</a>. . Jelly Roll, fresh out of prison, was attempting to make a career in the music industry, playing gigs for a few hundred bucks while he lived out of his car. Bunnie Xo, on the other hand, was living a slightly less impoverished lifestyle working as a high-end escort in Las Vegas. “When I met her I was like living out of a ’96 van and I was doing $100 a night shows…I was dead broke, and she just kind of took to me," Jelly Roll told Bert Kreischer, on the Bertcast podcast. And she was really making money in the sex work industry. Like, real money. I didn’t know that existed."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continued, "Where I’m from a prostitute is like ‘Two dolla holla!’ You know what I’m saying? It’s like ‘I’ll s*** your d*** for $50.’This was, I mean…15, 20…real money. If she ever writes a book…we’re talking about like CEOs of oil companies. People you know.”"</p><p>The "Son of a Sinner" crooner likes to joke that they met at a "plus-size male strip club", but the truth is that they first crossed paths when the singer was opening at the Las Vegas Country Saloon. The singer admitted that Bunnie didn't even know who he was at the time. ""We hit it off," he says. "She said she fell in love with the saddest eyes in the room."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jelly-roll-and-bunnie-xo.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bunnie had then invited Jelly Roll to crash at her pad in Vegas and in a short matter of time, their romance ignited. Jelly Roll, whose real name is Jason Deford, said that he went from crashing on her couch to eventually sleeping in her bed. Their relationship has often been judged since, with many assuming that Bunnie is a gold-digger of sort— an assertion that Jelly Roll laughs off. "I get tickled pink," he says, laughing. "I love it when they call her a gold digger, that's my favorite thing. She hates it. It infuriates her, it just flames her up."</p><p>"But it just tickles me pink because when I met her, I was homeless living out of a '96 conversion van. If anyone was digging for gold, it was I, Popeye. I was the one that was over here searching. I was couch surfing and made it to the bedroom," he adds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Country Rapper Jelly Roll Has An Enormous Net Worth, But His Youtuber Wife Bunnie Xo Might Make More Than Him</a></span></p><h2 id=does-jelly-roll-39-s-wife-get-along-with-his-daughter>Does Jelly Roll's Wife Get Along With His Daughter?</h2><p>One of Jelly Roll's most vivid memories was<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the day that he became a father</a>. The singer was actually incarcerated when he found out the news. “I’m sitting in there, and that guard knocks on my door May 22nd, 2008… He goes ‘you had a kid today,’ and he walked away. I still get emotional," Jelly Roll recalled. "It’s like a Damascus road experience in the Bible. I immediately…was like I’ve got to do something. I’ve got to quit this sh*t. I’ve got to figure it out.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jelly-roll-daughter-wife-bunnie-xo.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What's even more heartwarming is Bunnie Xo's relationship with his daughter, Bailee Ann— who was born May 22, 2008. What many people don't know is that Bunnie Xo helped Jelly Roll get full custody of his daughter. The pair have been raising Bailee Ann together since 2016 and Jelly Roll has expressed his gratitude for Bunnie's ability to love his daughter as if she were her own. "She's helped me raise my daughter. We've had custody of her the last nine years. It just takes a real selfless person to help raise a child they didn't birth," he says, gushing.</p><p>On her podcast, Dumb Blonde, Bunnie also opened up about leaving her days as an escort behind and how being in Bailee Ann's life was instrumental in her decision. "There’s a little girl who came into my life, and she stole my heart and I don’t want her to feel like she ever has to sell her body to support herself,” Bunnie said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Katy Perry Once Sued A Magazine Over Rumors She Cheated On Her Husband</a></span></p><h2 id=what-bunnie-xo-has-said-about-those-jelly-roll-cheating-and-divorce-rumors>What Bunnie Xo Has Said About Those Jelly Roll Cheating And Divorce Rumors</h2><p>After a brief split in 2018, many began to speculate that there were major issues between Jelly Roll and Bunnie Xo, namely infidelity. Bunnie opened up about her breakup in a video titled "The Breakup Vlog" on July 13, 2018, but refrained from going into further detail as to why the pair split saying that she has "her version" and Jelly Roll has his. However, it wasn't long before the couple reconciled in 2020 and bought a house together. Regardless of their making up, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors of the pair divorcing</a> and infidelity still remained.</p><p>As to what Bunnie has said about the cheating rumors, just look to her TikTok account where she claps back at haters and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> posts videos about how Jelly Roll would never cheat on her</a>. As for rumors of their divorce, the couple actually has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made plans to renew their vows</a> this year showing that they are, in fact, still going strong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a recent interview on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Superstar Power Hour with Audacy’s Katie and Company</a>, Jelly said, “Everybody says to do it in 10 years, but we’ve heard about the 7-year itch. So we’re like, let’s get ahead of this thing. Let’s double down on year seven.”</p><h2 id=how-jelly-roll-and-bunnie-xo-stay-connected>How Jelly Roll And Bunnie Xo Stay Connected</h2><p>Bunnie Xo and Jelly Roll maintain a connection in their relationship in a myriad of ways.
