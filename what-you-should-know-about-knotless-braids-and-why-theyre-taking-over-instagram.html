These new braids are a quick and easy method to update your look and are also <a href=#>very adaptable and gentler on your hair than traditional braids.</a> While most people consider braids merely a fashion statement, they serve a practical purpose by shielding the hair from damage such as split ends, breakage, and dryness brought on by the wearer's daily routine and environmental factors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# style=display:inline!important>We Searched The Internet To Find You The Easiest Braid Tutorials To Follow</a></span></p><p>And now, if the most popular braid pages on Instagram are any indication, knotless braids may be the answer to all of the issues with traditional braids, including shading. Not only do celebrities like Beyonc√©, Justine Skye, and <a href=#>Zendaya swear by these new must-haves,</a> but they're also being lauded as the healthier option for hair and scalp health. Considering giving knotless braids a shot? Here's everything you need to know beforehand.</p><h2 id=what-are-knotless-braids-and-how-do-they-differ-from-regular-braids>What Are Knotless Braids, And How Do They Differ From Regular Braids?</h2><p>Braids have been a classic hairstyle for generations in many African cultures. Still, they didn't become a mainstream beauty trend in the United States until Janet Jackson wore them in the movie "Poetic Justice" in 1993. These classic braid styles include sectioning the hair off and knotting together strands of synthetic hair at the scalp.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing to remember is that the beginning of the braiding technique is the same for both knotted and knotless braids. While knotless braids are also created by sectioning the hair, the hairdresser then braids an inch and a half or more of the natural hair before adding the synthetic strands one by one. As a result, Knotless braids are swiftly gaining popularity among many women due to their painlessness and the reduced risk of traction alopecia and follicular damage they offer compared to traditional braids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Those with sensitive scalps who dislike having their hair twisted in tightly love knotless braids because they require less pulling, breaking, and edge strain. Knotless braids have the added benefit of reducing the likelihood of buildup, which is frequent in other braids and can lead to irritation. You can easily style and twist your hair in any way you like, making them a popular alternative to box braids which require rest for a few days before you can style them.</p><p>Depending on your hair type and how well you maintain your knotless braids, they can last anywhere from six weeks to two months. Frizz occurs quicker with knotless braids than with traditional ones because more natural hair is exposed at the root. If you want a protective style that lasts longer than two months, you should wear traditional box braids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-39-s-the-best-way-of-maintaining-knotless-braids>What's the Best Way Of Maintaining Knotless Braids?</h2><p>If you spend a lot of money and seven hours sitting still while someone braids your hair, you want the result to last as long as possible. So, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ensure your hair gets enough moisture to prevent it from breaking</a> as you keep the braids on for weeks. As important as it is to wear a protective style, it's even more important to moisturize the hair, especially in cold weather.</p><p>Also, covering your head at night might help your braids last longer. Wearing a silk or satin scarf or bonnet to bed might help keep your hair from becoming tangled or frizzy while you sleep. Taking the time and working carefully through little hair pieces is vital when washing knotless braids, and braids will frizz and possibly unravel when washed too quickly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lathering shampoo and conditioner through the hair in a downward motion helps to keep the braids smooth so that they don't become frizz balls as you wash them. Using high-quality hair care products is also crucial when cleaning your knotless braids. Avoid using shampoos with heavy perfumes if you want your braids to smell fresh long after you've washed the shampoo out.</p><p>Professionals advise washing knotless braids once or twice every month. On the other hand, if you have an oily or dandruff-prone scalp and exercise frequently, you should wash your hair more regularly.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# style=display:inline!important>Kim Kardashian's Cornrow Braids Cause Controversy</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-prepare-your-hair-for-a-knotless-braiding-session>How To Prepare Your Hair For A Knotless Braiding Session</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Although knotless braids are an innovative hairstyle,</a> getting your hair ready for an installation is the same as it would be for any other protective hairstyle. It's essential to test the strength of your hair and scalp before committing to braid extensions, as the braids will add significant tension to your hair and scalp, even in the case of knotless braids.</p><p>Get rid of any dirt or oil on your scalp and hair first. Use a clarifying shampoo to remove residue. In the long run, this will make it easier to maintain control of your braids by reducing buildup. The hair should be deep-conditioned and blow-dried before extensions are applied. The extensions will look more natural if the hair is as smooth as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsawwYysn6itnJl6rLrOsGSamp%2BqwW63zairpZ2jqHqjvsCim6xlkaOxbsPHsmStoJWuv6Z505qioqaXYry3sdFmoKerpJa0s63MaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-you-should-know-about-knotless-braids-and-why-theyre-taking-over-instagram.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-you-should-know-about-knotless-braids-and-why-theyre-taking-over-instagram.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-you-should-know-about-knotless-braids-and-why-theyre-taking-over-instagram.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-you-should-know-about-knotless-braids-and-why-theyre-taking-over-instagram.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-you-should-know-about-knotless-braids-and-why-theyre-taking-over-instagram.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-you-should-know-about-knotless-braids-and-why-theyre-taking-over-instagram.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bre-tiesi-relationship-history-before-nick-cannon-selling-sunset.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bre-tiesi-relationship-history-before-nick-cannon-selling-sunset.html>Bre Tiesi's Relationship History Before Nick Cannon And Selling Sunset Was Just As Wild And Dramatic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sza-teases-lana-cover-art-ahead-of-sos-deluxe-release.html>SZA Teases Lana Cover Art Ahead of SOS Deluxe Release</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sza-teases-lana-cover-art-ahead-of-sos-deluxe-release.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
