However, Home Improvement was popular enough that fans wanted to know <a href=#>why Patricia Richardson quit</a> the show and <a href=#>what happened to Taran Noah Smith</a>.</p><p>Of course, every Home Improvement fan will likely remember when Jonathan Taylor Thomas became the show's breakout star. Following that, Taylor Thomas pretty much disappeared for years. After that absence, Taylor Thomas resurfaced which left the show's fans wondering things like if he was rich and married.</p><p>This article will reveal what is known about <strong>how much money Jonathan Taylor Thomas is worth</strong>, as of April 2024. Then, the article will look at what has been reported about <strong>Taylor Thomas' love life</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jonathan-taylor-thomas-is-still-a-wealthy-man-despite-leaving-hollywood-decades-ago>Jonathan Taylor Thomas Is Still A Wealthy Man Despite Leaving Hollywood Decades Ago</h2><p>When Jonathan Taylor Thomas was still a child, he was hired to star in a little sitcom starring an up-and-coming comedian named Tim Allen. Thankfully for Taylor Thomas, Home Improvement went on to be a smash hit that stayed on the air for eight seasons. However, Taylor Thomas decided to quit the show early as he barely appeared in the final season.</p><p>Since he was a huge star as a child and young adult, there was no doubt that Taylor Thomas was paid a lot of money. Then, Taylor Thomas shocked many observers when he left acting and the resulting big paydays behind.</p><p>Since Taylor Thomas disappeared for years, many fans have wondered how rich he is when he comes out of hiding. According to Celebrity Net Worth, <strong>Taylor Thomas remains a wealthy man</strong>, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he has a $12 million fortune</a> as of April 2024.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jonathan-taylor-thomas.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it may surprise some to learn that Taylor Thomas reportedly still has so much money, it makes sense for two main reasons. The first of those reasons is the fact that people underestimate how much money Taylor Thomas had the potential to make as a youngster.</p><p>When and where Jonathan Taylor Thomas born, according to Famous Birthdays?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>When was Jonathan Taylor Thomas born?:</p></td><td><p>September 8, 1981</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Where was Jonathan Taylor Thomas born?:</p></td><td><p>Bethlehem, Pennsylvania</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>How old is Jonathan Taylor Thomas as of April 2024?:</p></td><td><p>42 years old</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>When a show becomes as popular as Home Improvement once was, the series' stars typically make a lot of money. After all, the last thing the networks typically want is for the stars of a cash cow show to quit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With that in mind, it is all but certain that Taylor Thomas was paid a lot of money to star in Home Improvement. That is especially true considering that Taylor Thomas' Home Improvement salary would need to be adjusted for inflation to be put in the full context.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/did-jonathan-taylor-thomas-home-improvement-co-stars-treat-him-differently-after-he-became-a-teen-heartthrob_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Jonathan Taylor Thomas' Home Improvement Co-Stars Treat Him Differently When He Became A Teen Heartthrob?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>When Jonathan Taylor Thomas became one of the biggest teen heartthrobs in history, his Home Improvement co-stars noticed and reacted.</span><p>On top of Taylor Thomas' television salary, fans will remember that he headlined several movies. Since <strong>Taylor Thomas became one of the most popular teen heartthrobs</strong> in the world during the '90s, the movie studios wanted to work with him.</p><p>During the '90s, Taylor Thomas headlined movies like The Lion King, Man of the House, Tom and Huck, Wild America, and I'll Be Home for Christmas, among others. While there is no way to know how much Taylor Thomas made from each of those roles, that would add up quickly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jonathan-taylor-thomas-in-a-promo-shot-for-i-ll-be-home-for-christmas-1998.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The second reason that it isn't surprising that Taylor Thomas would still be wealthy is that is also the case for most of his former co-stars. According to Celebrity Net Worth, almost all of <strong>Home Improvement's former stars continue to have impressive fortunes</strong> as of April 2024.</p><p>Of course, it shouldn't surprise anyone that Tim Allen is the wealthiest former Home Improvement star. After all, Allen has starred in a slew of movies, including the Santa Clause and Toy Story series, and he also headlined the sitcom Last Man Standing.</p><p>Thanks to all of Allen's success, he has a $100 million fortune, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/does-zachery-ty-bryan-still-earn-massive-home-improvement-royalties-despite-his-jail-time-and-felony-charges_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Does Zachery Ty Bryan Still Earn Massive Home Improvement Royalties Despite His Jail Time And Felony Charges?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Former Home Improvement star Zachary Ty Bryan has gotten into serious trouble which may affect his royalty payments from the beloved sitcom.</span><p>In addition to Taylor Thomas and Allen, two more former Home Improvement stars are worth $10 million or above, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>The outlet reports that Patricia Richardson is worth $20 million and Richard Karn has a $10 million fortune as of April 2024.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Home-Improvement-Cast.jpg><p>Celebrity Net Worth also reports that Debbe Dunning is worth $4 million and Earl Hindman's estate is worth the same amount. Finally, the outlet reports that Zachery Ty Bryan is worth $5 million and Taran Noah Smith has a $300,000 fortune.</p><p>After starring in Home Improvement, <a href=#>Taran Noah Smith went on to have a controversial and costly marriage</a> . Noah Smith and his ex-wife, who was 16 years older, opened a failed business that lost a lot of money. On top of that, Noah Smith has claimed his ex-wife took money out of his account. With all that in mind, it makes sense that Noah Smith is only worth $300,000 as of April 2024.</p><p>Considering that Noah Smith reportedly is the only Home Improvement star who isn't worth millions, it would be shocking if Taylor Thomas had somehow gone broke.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jonathan-taylor-thomas-keeps-his-love-life-a-secret>Jonathan Taylor Thomas Keeps His Love Life A Secret</h2><p>When Jonathan Taylor Thomas was one of the world's top teen heartthrobs, there were millions of youngsters who were smitten with him.

Who's Dated Who also reports that it was rumored that Taylor Thomas was involved with a woman named Jessica Bowman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jonathan-taylor-thomas-when-he-was-a-teen-heartthrob.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, once Taylor Thomas stepped away from the spotlight, the media stopped reporting on his love life. That has resulted in <strong>nothing being known about who Taylor Thomas dated in the 2010s and 2020s</strong>.</p><p>According to We Got This Covered, it can be stated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Thomas has never gotten married</a>. However, the outlet admits that there is no way to know if Taylor Thomas has been single, dating, or in a long-term relationship during the 2010s and 2020s.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKaRqbWiuoytmLKkn6d6tbTOppisZZ6awW7DzquroWWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6tMDAraysZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjonathan-taylor-thomas-net-worth-relationship-status.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjonathan-taylor-thomas-net-worth-relationship-status.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjonathan-taylor-thomas-net-worth-relationship-status.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjonathan-taylor-thomas-net-worth-relationship-status.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjonathan-taylor-thomas-net-worth-relationship-status.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjonathan-taylor-thomas-net-worth-relationship-status.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./monique-netflix-comedy-special-announcement-1234679389.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./monique-netflix-comedy-special-announcement-1234679389.html>Mo'Nique Lands Comedy Special On Netflix</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jim-jones-net-worth.html>Jim Jones Net Worth - KahawaTungu</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jim-jones-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
