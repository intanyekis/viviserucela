The emperors and Tsars reigned over Russia for generations. They helped in shaping the rich cultural heritage of the country. The Russian empire flourished under the rule of Romanovs. Although there were some rough patches, the Romanovs took Russia to glory in their years. After the Rurikid Dynasty in 1613, the Romanov reign ended in 1917. <a href=#>The Romanovs</a> are the direct descendants of Andrey Ivanovich Kobyla. Romanovs acquired their name from Roman Yurev, whose daughter Anastasiya was the first wife of Ivan IV.</p><p>The Romanov Dynasty has also greatly influenced Russian culture and history. A powerful dynasty that ruled for generations, the Romanovs took Russia to great heights. The rich heritage and <a href=#>inherited wealth sum up to a total of around $300 billion</a>. The Romanovs came into being after the Rurikid Dynasty in 1613.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>World's Richest Family: The Trillion-Dollar Rothschild Dynasty</a></span></p><h2 id=the-beginning-of-their-reign>The Beginning Of Their Reign</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Romanovs started their reign when a 'zemsky sobor' (assembly of the land) elected Michael Romanov as the new Tsar after the 'Time Of Troubles'. Michael, I reinstated order in Moscow over the first years of his power and established two major government offices. These offices were essential to Russian order for many decades. Alexis ascended the throne in 1646. He ruled for 30 years till his death in 1676. Riots in cities such as Pskov and Novgorod and wars with Sweden and Poland marked his reign. Alexis established a new legal code called 'Subornoye Ulozheniye', which required official state documentation to travel between towns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Alexis I died in 1676, there was a dispute between the children of his first wife and the son of his second wife. The crown was passed down through the children of his first wife. Fyodor III died from illness after ruling for six years. Between 1682 and 1689, the power consented between <a href=#>the remaining siblings</a>. Sofia, the daughter of the first wife, opposed Peter, the second wife's son, to support her brother Ivan V. Ivan and Peter jointly assumed the throne till Ivan's death in 1696. Peter became the Emperor of all of Russia and ruled until he died in 1725. He built a new capital in St. Petersburg, where he established a navy and attempted to control the Baltic sea.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=the-change-of-power>The Change Of Power</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Catherine, I <a href=#>ascended the throne</a> after Peter. She was a Romanov only by right of marriage. Upon her death, the throne reverted to Peter II, the grandson of Peter I. He was followed by Ivan V's surviving daughter Anna. As she died, there was a bit of confusion regarding the throne. Elizabeth, daughter of Peter I and Catherine I, assumed the throne in 1741. She died in 1772, ending the Romanov male line. Her nephew, Peter III's widow, assumed the throne in 1762 and ruled till 1796 as Catherine II. Paul I, Peter III's son, followed her.</p><p>Paul changed the succession law, establishing a definite order of succession for the Romanov family members. Conspirators supporting his son Alexander I murdered him, and Alexander ruled from 1801 to 1825. After his death, his brother Constantine declined the throne giving power to another brother Nicholas I, who ruled from 1825 to 1855. The successors were Alexander II, Alexander III, and Nicholas II.</p><h2 id=the-last-tsar-and-the-end>The Last Tsar And The End</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nicholas II was crowned ruler in 1886. The Russo-Japanese war had a disastrous outcome, which led to the Russian Revolution in 1905. This ended after Nicholas approved a representative assembly and promised constitutional reforms. The Tsar went back to his old ways as the commotion subsided and dissolved the representative assembly, leading the public to support revolutionary groups like the Bolsheviks. Nicholas led Russia to <a href=#>World War I</a> in 1914. After the defeat at the hands of Germany, revolution broke out in 1917, and Nicholas abdicated his throne. He was executed with his family in 1918, ending the Romanov rule -- as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">History</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Meet The Mars Family: Americaâ€™s Third-Wealthiest Family Dynasty</a></span></p><h2 id=the-romanov-palace-and-historical-importance>The Romanov Palace And Historical Importance</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apart from gathering riches that amount to more than $300 billion, the House Of Romanov holds excellent significance in Russian history, as per the current inflation rate.
