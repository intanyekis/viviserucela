His career got off to a rocky start, as he was repeatedly booed off the stage. Following those initial failures, Hart continued competing in comedy competitions throughout Massachusetts, and audience reactions to his performances gradually improved.</p><p>Hart had to work hard to develop his own comedic style. After attempting to imitate comedians such as Chris Tucker at first, he finally discovered his own rhythm by delving into his insecurities and life experiences. His breakthrough role came when Judd Apatow cast him in a recurring role on the TV series Undeclared, which led to roles in Scary Movie, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and Meet Dave.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following the success of his first stand-up album in 2008, Hart embarked on his first comedy tour, I'm A Grown Little Man.
