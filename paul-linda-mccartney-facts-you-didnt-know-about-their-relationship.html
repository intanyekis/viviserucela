Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>, Paul McCartney went to celebrate with some friends at one of his favorite clubs in London. What he didn't know was that it would be the night he would meet the love of his life. Linda had traveled to England for work. She was a photographer who had previously worked with several rock bands. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul said that she immediately caught his eye</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was near the edge and stood up just as she was passing, blocking her exit. And so I said, 'Oh, sorry. Hi. How are you? How’re you doing?' I introduced myself, and said, 'We’re going on to another club after this, would you like to join us?' That was my big pulling line! Well, I’d never used it before, of course, but it worked this time! It was a fairly slim chance but it worked."</p><h2 id=they-didn-t-see-each-other-for-a-year-after-they-met><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>They Didn't See Each Other For A Year After They Met</span></h2><p>Paul and Linda spent the night they met together, and he invited her to a press party so that she could get photos of the band, but after that, Linda returned to the US. She had a daughter and a job, and she didn't think what happened with Paul would be anything other than a great night. Paul, for his part, got engaged to his girlfriend Jane Asher, but they broke up soon after. It wasn't until a year later that they would meet again when Paul McCartney traveled to New York. After that, he flew Linda and her daughter Heather to London and they began officially dating, with Paul becoming a father figure for the little girl.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-tried-to-stop-their-wedding><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Fans Tried To Stop Their Wedding</span></h2><p>As most people know, Beatlemania was a dangerous thing. <a href=#>The Beatles </a>even had to stop playing live shows because the fans were screaming so loud they couldn't even hear their own music. McCartney's wedding was no different. Paul proposed to her after dating for a year, and although they tried to keep the ceremony secret and simple, fans found out. The stairs of the courthouse where they got married were filled with weeping young girls, and there were so many people on the streets that the police had to escort the car the happy couple was riding because girls were trying to block the doors.</p><h2 id=they-almost-called-off-the-wedding-the-night-before><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They Almost Called Off The Wedding The Night Before</span></h2><p>Even the most loving couples have fights and disagreements, and Paul and Linda had a big one the night before they were supposed to get married. McCartney didn't say what it was about, but he&nbsp; said that they got carried away and were so angry they thought about canceling the wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Of The Longest Married Couples In The Music Industry</a></span></p><p>"We were crazy," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul said</a>. "We had a big argument the night before we got married and it was nearly called off. We were very up and down, quite funky compared to the eventual image of '25 years of married bliss! Aren't they lucky for people in showbiz?' But we are. You get this picture of us swanning along in a little rowboat managing to avoid the white water, but we were right in the middle of that white water, man, so it's even more miraculous that we made it. But we did."</p><h2 id=she-helped-him-move-on-from-the-beatles><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She Helped Him Move On From The Beatles</span></h2><p>When <a href=#>The Beatles </a>broke up, Paul was depressed. For the past decade, his life had revolved around the band, and suddenly he found himself with nothing to do. He didn't feel like writing music on his own, and he credits Linda for helping him get out of that dark spot. He said recently in an interview with Apple Music that he doesn't want to imagine what would have happened if he hadn't had her by his side to help him get over it. He got back to writing, made two amazing records, and then formed the band Wings with her. The song Maybe I'm Amazed on his debut album McCartney is dedicated to her, and it's about how much he loves her and how grateful he is to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-couple-moved-to-scotland-to-escape-from-the-spotlight><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Couple Moved To Scotland To Escape From The Spotlight</span></h2><p>After the scandalous breakup of the greatest band in the world, the newlyweds needed to escape all the attention. Linda had the idea of moving to Scotland, where Paul owned a farm he rarely visited. She loved nature and the peace of the countryside, and Paul learned to love it too. She taught him to ride horses, which he loves to do to this day, and the couple raised their kids there.</p><p>"Going up to Scotland was real freedom. It was an escape – our means of finding a new direction in life and having time to think about what we really wanted to do," <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul said</a>.</p><h2 id=he-convinced-her-to-learn-to-play-music><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Convinced Her To Learn To Play Music</span></h2><p>Listening to his first two solo albums, McCartney and RAM, the listener can tell that Linda had musical talent, even if she hadn't explored it much. She did the backing vocals for both records, which gave the songs more depth, and Paul loved working with her. That's why, when he decided he wanted to be in a band again, he told her he wanted her to be in it. At first, Linda was reluctant. She didn't play any instruments and she had never played on stage. But Paul insisted and she eventually agreed. He taught her to play keyboards and she ended up loving it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>All The Cars The Beatles Have Owned (And Where They Are Now)</a></span></p><p>They formed the band Wings, starting completely from scratch, and it wasn't easy. The first album received very bad reviews, but the Beatle knew what he was doing. Touring and making music became a family affair for the couple, and they toured with their children, spending every minute together.</p><h2 id=they-only-spent-eleven-days-apart><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>They Only Spent Eleven Days Apart</span></h2><p>Paul McCartney has said proudly multiple times that he and Linda were never apart. Even after&nbsp;Wings&nbsp;broke up, she went with him on tour, and when they were at home they were always together. The only time they were apart was when Paul had to spend 11 days in jail in Japan. They were on tour, and when they entered the country security found pot on him, so he was put in jail. They reunited once he was released and never spent another night without one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-last-words-to-linda><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>His Last Words To Linda</span></h2><p>When Paul was 14 he lost his mother to breast cancer. Years later, he lost the love of his life the same way. It was heartbreaking to him, but at least he was able to make every moment with Linda count. She spent her last days in Tucson, Arizona, in the family ranch with Paul and their children.</p><p>"The kids and I were there when she crossed over,"&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul said in a heartbreaking statement</a>. "They each were able to tell her how much they loved her. Finally I said to her, 'You’re up on your beautiful Appaloosa stallion. It’s a fine spring day…and the sky is clear blue.' I had barely got to the end of the sentence when she closed her eyes and gently slipped away."</p><h2 id=paul-cried-for-a-year-after-her-death><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Paul Cried For A Year After Her Death</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Linda passed away on April 17, 1998, surrounded by the people who loved her the most. It was one of the most difficult moments in Paul's life, but unlike the time his mother passed away, he allowed himself to grieve openly.</p>"I think I cried for about a year on and off," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul shared</a> . "You expect to see them walk in, this person you love, because you are so used to them. I cried a lot. It was almost embarrassing except it seemed the only thing to do."Although he will never forget the woman he loved for 30 years, Paul has since found peace and moved on. <a href=#>Now he's happily married to his wife Nancy Shevell</a> and can look back on his time with Linda with love and happiness.&nbsp; <span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Yoko Ono And John Lennon: 10 Things You Didn't Know About Their Relationship</a></span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinmq2cYrmqusOaZKabk5a%2FtbrEsmSfmZOpwG7Fzq5knaGUo8Fut82ormaZkqTCtXnToZyiql2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1w</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpaul-linda-mccartney-facts-you-didnt-know-about-their-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpaul-linda-mccartney-facts-you-didnt-know-about-their-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpaul-linda-mccartney-facts-you-didnt-know-about-their-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpaul-linda-mccartney-facts-you-didnt-know-about-their-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpaul-linda-mccartney-facts-you-didnt-know-about-their-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpaul-linda-mccartney-facts-you-didnt-know-about-their-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tyrese-singing-bus-black-rose-coca-cola-commercial-361657.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tyrese-singing-bus-black-rose-coca-cola-commercial-361657.html>Tyrese Promotes 'Black Rose' With Reenactment Of 1994 Coca-Cola Commercial</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./full-video-milagros-monserrat-domain-6-video.html>Milagros Monserrat Twitter Video The Talks Today</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./full-video-milagros-monserrat-domain-6-video.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
