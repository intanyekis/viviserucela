I love her work, but life’s too short to deal with people like this in the business.</p>— Steven DeKnight (@stevendeknight) <a href=#>March 7, 2023</a></figure><p>“She’s young, so maybe she doesn’t know any better (but she should),” he continued in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter thread</a>. “She should also ask herself how she would feel if the showrunners gave an interview and talked about how difficult she was and refused to perform the material.”</p><p>While he loves her work, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he continued</a>, life is “too short” to “deal with people” like her in the industry.</p><p>Debating the debacle with other Twitter users, DeKnight — who also worked on series including “Daredevil” and “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">called Ortega’s behavior </a>“extremely unprofessional,” adding that, in his opinion, actors should <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">air their concerns</a> behind the scenes and not “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">trash the writing</a>” on a public podcast.</p><p>“In this business, it’s extremely bad form to throw your collaborators under a creative bus,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he declared</a>.</p><p>The Post has reached out to Ortega’s representatives for comment.</p><p>On 48-year-old Shepard’s podcast last week, the “Wednesday” star admitted that she put her “foot down,” verging on being “unprofessional” for the sake of her Addams Family character, of whom she was “very protective.”</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve ever had to put my foot down more on a set in a way that I had to on ‘Wednesday,’” she said. “Everything that Wednesday does, everything I had to play, did not make sense for her character at all.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/NYPICHPDPICT000004983731.jpg><p>She said her character taking part in a “love triangle” had “made no sense,” and she repeatedly told writers “No” on plot points — even at times “changing lines” herself in the script.</p><p>“There were times on that set where I even became almost unprofessional in a sense, where I just started changing lines,” the “Scream VI” actress continued. “The script supervisor thought I was going with something and then I had to sit down with the writers, and they’d be like, ‘Wait, what happened to the scene?’ And I’d have to go and explain why I couldn’t go do certain things.”</p><p>She even went so far as to admit that she was dissatisfied most of the time with her performance.</p><p><a href=#>There “was not a scene”</a> during production where she “went home and was like, ‘OK, that should be fine,'” she confessed.</p><p>Her faltering confidence in the series belied the show’s insurmountable success: It quickly rose as the streaming giant’s second-largest English-language show of all time.</p><p>Netflix said it logged a whopping 1.02 billion hours viewed in the three weeks after its Nov. 16 debut, with more than 150 million homes watching.</p><p>The only other shows that previously crossed the 1 billion-hours mark in just 28 days were “Squid Game” and “Stranger Things 4,” the streamer added.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">As Elle’s April 2023 cover star</a>, the young performer told the magazine she was “scared” that she wouldn’t “live up to people’s expectations,” adding that receiving compliments is “unbelievable.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

deter the show’s producers from working with her again.</p><p><a href=#>Not only will Ortega play Wednesday</a> in a second season, but she will serve as an executive producer herself.</p><p>The show’s director, Tim Burton, had nothing but shiny things to offer about his lead actress, saying Ortega had Wednesday “in her soul.”</p><p>“You have to kind of ‘be’ Wednesday, and that’s what Jenna is,” Burton told Elle. “Whether she likes it or not, she’s got that in her soul, and as a person.”</p><p class=postsid
