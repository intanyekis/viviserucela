While her real estate know-how was impressive from her very first episode, fans couldn't help but focus on her unique relationship with <a href=#><strong>Nick Cannon</strong></a>. Tiesi and Cannon share a son named Legendary Love Cannon, who is baby number eight for the singer. Since <a href=#>Nick Cannon has 12 children</a>, his personal life is always making headlines.</p><p>Before Bre Tiesi became a reality star famous for being the mother of one of Nick Cannon's children, she was in two other notable relationships. Here's who Tiesi was romantically involved with before she developed feelings for Cannon and became a mom.</p><h2 id=who-did-selling-sunset-star-bre-tiesi-date-before-nick-cannon>Who Did Selling Sunset Star Bre Tiesi Date Before Nick Cannon?</h2><p>Not every new Selling Sunset cast member sticks around, but it seems fair to assume that Bre Tiesi will continue starring in the popular reality series. She commands attention in every scene, knows how to stand up for herself, and has an interesting life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since viewers would hate it if Selling Sunset became boring, Tiesi should definitely be praised for bringing her great personality to the show.</p><p>While Bre Tiesi shared a lot about Nick Cannon on Selling Sunset, the reality series didn't do a deep dive into who she used to date. The reality star has been married once: to Johnny Manziel, a quarterback who played for the NFL. The couple tied the knot in March 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar52005019-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Around 12 months later, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bre Tiesi and Johnny Manziel were having problems</a>. According to People, Tiesi thought that Johnny had an affair. She talked about it on Instagram and said, “U been married? U been betrayed? I don’t do betrayal for a person I was devoted to period. Vows were broken f— money and f— u and every other loser on here.” However, the post isn't available anymore as it seems that Tiesi got rid of it. It's possible that she didn't want people to message her about what she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/johnny-manziel.jpg><p>A source explained to People that when Tiesi returned home from Bali, she felt that something was wrong. The source said, “She went away, and when she got back, she thought he had been cheating. She somehow found out, and she was irate.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Cast Of Selling Sunset, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>TMZ reported that the divorce was official in November 2021. Since then, it seems that Tiesi is very happy with the way her life is. Page Six reported in January 2023 that she answered some questions on her Instagram account and said that she was "never" interested in being someone's wife. Tiesi said she “only dreamed of traveling the world and being the top of [her] career, creating an empire, creating generational wealth and living life to [the] fullest with” her family."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bre-tiesi-s-relationship-history-before-nick-cannon-and-selling-sunset-was-just-as-wild-and-dramatic.jpg><p>She explained that when she and Johnny Manziel tied the knot, she wasn't wearing a wedding dress. She also said they "didn't have a wedding."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In January 2023, Tiesi said that she loves being a mom to her son and isn't going to add to her family. But in June 2023, she told Entertainment Tonight, “I do and I don't. I think that for where I’m at in my career and my life right now, I just don’t know how I could possibly manage another child.”</p><p>If the allegations are true and Tiesi ended her marriage because of cheating, it makes sense that she wouldn't want to be married again. It also sounds like she is comfortable on her own because, as she has shared on Selling Sunset and on social media, she has many people in her life who help her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nick-hogan.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bre Tiesi was also in a relationship with Nick Hogan.

It doesn't seem that Tiesi has ever talked about being with him. While the romance got some attention since Nick is the son of Hulk Hogan, neither Tiesi nor Nick Hogan has been open about why they broke up.</p><p>However, some publications have talked about Bre Tiesi's physical appearance during the years that she was seeing Nick Hogan. Page Six noted that she has had some plastic surgery since then. Tiesi has mentioned the procedures that she had done. She said on Instagram that she got Botox, filler, and a nose job.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-selling-sunset-star-bre-tiesi-39-s-relationship-with-nick-cannon-like-today>What Is Selling Sunset Star Bre Tiesi's Relationship With Nick Cannon Like Today?</h2><p>In many episodes of season 6 of Selling Sunset, Bre Tiesi mentioned that she and Nick Cannon are still romantically involved, but their romance doesn't look like what people would expect. While other cast members like Chelsea Lazkani questioned it, Tiesi shrugged off the criticism and said that it worked for her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/selling-sunset-bre-tiesi.jpg><p>According to Today.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bre Tiesi talked about Nick Cannon</a> on the Know For Sure podcast in 2022.

She explained, "It's not necessarily anything. This is just us, this is our relationship and what you do outside of that is what you do outside of that.

We don't really define it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In March 2022, she was interviewed by E!

She mentioned that she can see other people and so can Nick.</p><p>In May 2023, Tiesi was interviewed by People and she mentioned how she is portrayed on the reality show. She said, "I think that, yes, there's some drama that is, let's say, dramatized, I'm not really sure the word to use with this one, but there's some of my personal life in a situation that happens with Nick and all of these things that are not fully accurate. So I think that some of that I'm not excited about or thrilled is occurring."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tiesi continued to People, "For me, it's just one of those things where people have to take it with a grain of salt and understand that there's a difference. There still is a difference between my real life and the show."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq51dqbamv8hmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpZZiewLW70bJkm52WpL%2Bmec2imqRlk5a7r7vNZqqepJyeu6h50q6lrJ2kZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbre-tiesi-relationship-history-before-nick-cannon-selling-sunset.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbre-tiesi-relationship-history-before-nick-cannon-selling-sunset.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbre-tiesi-relationship-history-before-nick-cannon-selling-sunset.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbre-tiesi-relationship-history-before-nick-cannon-selling-sunset.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbre-tiesi-relationship-history-before-nick-cannon-selling-sunset.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbre-tiesi-relationship-history-before-nick-cannon-selling-sunset.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./explaining-the-ending-and-plot-of-black-mirrors-men-against-fire.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./explaining-the-ending-and-plot-of-black-mirrors-men-against-fire.html>Explaining the Ending and Plot of Black Mirrors Men Against Fire</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-you-should-know-about-knotless-braids-and-why-theyre-taking-over-instagram.html>What You Should Know About Knotless Braids and Why Theyre Taking Over Instagram</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-you-should-know-about-knotless-braids-and-why-theyre-taking-over-instagram.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
