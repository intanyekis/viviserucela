As a result, the multi-talented singer and dancer has been in high demand for almost two decades in one way or another. Most recently, he made his way to Las Vegas to take up a residency and perform to huge crowds every night.</p><p>While the residency has been highly successful and has even been extended as a result of its popularity, not everyone is impressed. What demographic is having second thoughts about attending the concert and why? Fans might be surprised to learn that the reason is quite relatable, even if it doesn't actually stop anyone from going to see Usher in concert.</p><h2 id=usher-39-s-vegas-show-is-drawing-massive-crowds>Usher's Vegas Show Is Drawing Massive Crowds</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/usher-on-stage-and-usher-closeup.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The popular and well-attended residency in Sin City couldn't have come at a better time, with <a href=#>Usher trying to financially overcome setbacks</a> from previous relationships. Thankfully, the shows have been very well received, with even the low-level tickets going for $500 each.</p><p>While this exorbitant cost prevents most of the average population from attending one of the shows, there are still plenty of individuals and diehard Usher fans who are willing and able to fork out the funds to catch the star in action.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/this-is-the-bizarre-reason-usher-has-50-las-vegas-concerts-in-2023.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Fans Will Need To Save To See Usher In Las Vegas (And He's Making Bank)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Usher is all set to make bank for his Las Vegas residency, and fans will have to pay the price.</span><p>Because his shows have become so popular, <a href=#>an agreement was made to extend the residency</a> and add more shows to the already lengthy and demanding schedule. With the additional opportunities available to see the singer behind hits like "Love In This Club" and "My Boo," many would think that the demand would decrease and the chances of getting tickets would become more accessible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the excitement level for the show in 2023 proved to be just as strong as in July 2022 when Usher first started his residency in the city. With that, the cost remained high, and every show was busting at the seams with guests.</p><h2 id=even-celebrities-are-enjoying-usher-39-s-las-vegas-residency>Even Celebrities Are Enjoying Usher's Las Vegas Residency</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/keke-palmer-was-rumored-to-have-dated-a-small-number-of-celebrities-before-seeing-her-current-husband-darius-jackson.jpg><p>Anyone who has been in the entertainment industry for a period of time is subject to scandal with other celebrities and close associates. Usher has seen his fair share of feuds, <a href=#>including one with Chris Brown</a>, that have brought negative attention to the star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, his residency hasn't been problem-free, as many celebrity fans have flocked to Las Vegas to see Usher on stage. In September 2022, Taraji P. Henson secured a ticket to the show and was brought on stage by the musician himself. In later months, musician Rae was seen in the audience and serenaded in front of thousands by Usher.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>This Is The Reason Usher Has 25 Las Vegas Concerts In 2023</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Lots of artists have residencies in Las Vegas, but Usher Raymond seems to really enjoy his time there.</span><p>However, the real trouble came when Keke Palmer decided to check out what all the hype was about and attended one of the iconic Usher shows on a trip to Las Vegas. Excited to check out the show, Palmer dressed in a sheer dress and joined the crowd.</p><p>Usher took notice and allegedly invited her on stage, where video and pictures were taken of her and posted online. While Keke was having the time of her life, her partner at the time, who is also the father of her son, was not pleased, but it wasn't exactly Usher that was the problem.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With a bit of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">back-and-forth dialogue</a>, the upset over Keke's clothing and 'behavior' was vocalized between the two online. While people have their opinions on what should and should not have happened, it is all in the past, and Palmer has gone on to collaborate with Usher on a music video for a single released during the residency.</p><h2 id=bill-bellamy-joked-that-men-shouldn-39-t-take-their-wives-to-see-usher>Bill Bellamy Joked That Men Shouldn't Take Their Wives To See Usher</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Although one partner didn't take kindly to the show, it wasn't because of anything Usher did. On the other hand, Bill Bellamy discovered that he maybe shouldn't have sprung for the tickets when he saw his wife and other women's reactions to the show.</p><p>Spoken in jest, he mentioned that men should probably re-think taking their wives to the show because of the energy and emotion that comes with the musician's on-stage presence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Are Chilli And Usher Still Friends?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Chilli once said that Usher did the "ultimate no-no" when they were dating...</span><p>The comedian went on to praise Usher and the show he put on in Vegas. Bellamy offered that everyone should go see it, even though women were "fainting" all over the place. Continuing, Bellamy said he loved how Usher moved all around the stage and interacted with the audience, coming down to their level to sing and be closer to them.</p><p>Following the farewell round of shows ending the star's residency in Vegas, will life go back to normal for Usher? Having not toured since 2018, will people see another round of shows take place worldwide, or will he <a href=#>take time to relax</a> and enjoy his family? Only time will tell.</p><p>However, it goes without saying that the singer has a massively dedicated fan base that will follow him to all ends of the earth, no matter what direction he decides to take.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYq6zsYyuqqGdomK5or%2BMr5ygmaNiwKm71qxkpaGbmnw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-are-usher-las-vegas-shows-like.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-are-usher-las-vegas-shows-like.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-are-usher-las-vegas-shows-like.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-are-usher-las-vegas-shows-like.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-are-usher-las-vegas-shows-like.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-are-usher-las-vegas-shows-like.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ozzie-guillen-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ozzie-guillen-net-worth.html>Ozzie Guilln Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./matthew-carnahan-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Matthew Carnahan Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./matthew-carnahan-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
