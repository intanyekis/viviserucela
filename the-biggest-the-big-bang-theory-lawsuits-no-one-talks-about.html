Sheldon Cooper, Leonard Hofstadter, and Penny were the focal point of the friend group and were equal parts hilarious and educational. Because of TBBT’s success, it’s been said that it cost production <a href=#>$9 million per episode</a> in the final season to continue the friend group’s story. Stars like <a href=#>Kaley Cuoco (Penny) had made a fortune</a> from TBBT, but as is the case with many top shows, lawsuits soon followed the show’s craze.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>TBBT was such a strong force to behold that many of the lawsuits against the show were buried in the newsroom. Creating a negative spin on the series, its content, or its stars was seemingly impossible because of TBBT’s strong fan base.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Highest-Grossing Jim Parsons Movies, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=sheldon-s-soft-kitty-caused-some-controversy>Sheldon’s “Soft Kitty” Caused Some Controversy</h2><p>Sheldon Cooper had his fair share of unique qualities that made him stand out in the friend group. One of those qualities was the ability to make those around him feel sorry for him, even though he didn’t always treat them fairly. This was especially the case when he was sick. Being away from home, Sheldon—who was a stereotypical “mama’s boy”—missed his mom when he was feeling under the weather. One of the things he missed most was when she sang “Soft Kitty.” The first time fans heard the lullaby was when Cooper demanded Penny sing it for him before he went to bed since his mom wasn’t there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, pur, pur, pur.”</p><p><a href=#>Sheldon Cooper had some of the funniest lines</a>, and the short song won audiences over and it soon became a part of Sheldon’s character. What some fans don’t know, however, is that the song was allegedly used without the creator’s permission, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>. The daughters of the song’s creator, Ellen Newlin Chase and Margaret Chase Perry, filed a suit against CBS in 2015 for copyright violation. Because of how popular the song became, the family was bothered the network used it without permission.</p><p>The lawsuit, however, was eventually dismissed by a judge because, as it turned out, production did get permission to use the lyrics from the parent company that produces “Soft Kitty” in one of its children’s books. The problem was that Newlin Chase and Chase Perry were left in the dark over the deal. Because the network did seek permission from the start, the case was dropped.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tbbt-s-very-popular-theme-song-went-to-court>TBBT’s Very Popular Theme Song Went To Court</h2><p>It’s rare to have a theme song that’s as popular (if not more) as the show itself, but TBBT proves itself successful in all aspects. Written by The Barenaked Ladies, <a href=#>TBBT’s theme song made millions</a> as it was tailored to the “Big Bang’s” concept and talked about the world’s creation in a fun, creative way.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: </span><a href=#>The Truth Behind Big Bang Theory's Controversial Use Of "Soft Kitty"</a></p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Metro</a>, the band’s frontman Ed Robertson was approached by TBBT’s creators to write the theme. Robertson, however, wasn’t sure the job was right for him and the band because of past TV work that didn’t end well. Once Robertson learned that Chuck Lorre was behind the series, he knew TBBT could be a hit and wound up writing the song with the help of his band.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ScreenRant</a>, In 2015 (eight years after the song’s creation), former band member Steven Page filed a lawsuit against Robertson. <a href=#>Because of the millions of dollars</a> the Barenaked Ladies’ theme generated due to the syndication factor of one of the most successful sitcoms of all time, Page sought money he claimed he was promised. The site revealed that Page agreed to 20% of the song’s revenue but never wound up seeing those earnings. The outcome of the lawsuit has never been released, but it's hinted that the case was settled when Page joined the band for a concert in 2018.</p><h2 id=there-was-an-age-discrimination-suit-brought-against-warner-bros>There Was An Age Discrimination Suit Brought Against Warner Bros.</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In August 2016, former assistant director&nbsp;Christopher Klausen filed a discrimination lawsuit against Warner Bros. Television after feeling pushed out by executives after working on&nbsp;The Big Bang Theory for seven years. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a> shared that&nbsp;Klausen believes he was allegedly fired after turning 50 and was shunned by the cast and crew.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wrap</a>, Klausen's duties were reassigned to other assistant directors who were in their '20s and '30s. After Season 8, he received a call that his contract was terminated based on performance. As one of <a href=#>Warner Bros. highest-grossing shows</a>, Klausen believed he was wrongfully terminated and filed a 25-page suit. Shortly after the filing, the lawsuit was settled but neither Warner Bros. nor Klausen commented on the matter.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kanye West Fired An Employee For Wanting To Play Drake’s Music</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=copy-cat>Copy Cat</h2><p>After releasing in 1007,&nbsp;TBBT was easily one of the most popular sitcoms on TV. The combination of a "geeky" scientific friend group and the beautiful neighbor across the hall worked with viewers. In fact, it worked so well that another production company in Belarus essentially copied the series.</p><p><a href=#>The Things</a>&nbsp;shared that&nbsp;TBBT creators were made aware of a very similar show airing in Belarus called&nbsp;The Theorists.&nbsp;In a card that appeared at the end of an episode, Lorre wrote, "Belarus does have a bustling TV production industry. One of their most recent hits is a sitcom about four nerdy scientists who live next door to a beautiful blonde waitress. The characters are named Sheldon, Leo, Hovard, Raj, and Natasha, and the show is entitled, The Theorists." This was Lorre's way of getting back at the copycats for stealing his work and rebranding it despite how huge&nbsp;TBBT was (and how notable&nbsp;<a href=#>TBBT's </a><a href=#>cast's net worths were</a>.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the end, a lawsuit never came to be because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Starte Facts</a> shared that once the Belarus actors found out that they were working on a stolen show, they quit in unison. The Theorists was later canceled and&nbsp;TBBT lived on.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:<a href=#>&nbsp;The Simon Helberg Way: How Howard Wolowitz From 'Big Bang Theory' Earned Made His $45 Million Fortune</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Economic Times</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMm6Cgn5WowW7Ax55km6GXYq%2BiusZmq6Gdn6fGbrjAsKquoaSoeq%2B7jKilnmWklrmsv4yamaitpGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-biggest-the-big-bang-theory-lawsuits-no-one-talks-about.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-biggest-the-big-bang-theory-lawsuits-no-one-talks-about.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-biggest-the-big-bang-theory-lawsuits-no-one-talks-about.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-biggest-the-big-bang-theory-lawsuits-no-one-talks-about.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-biggest-the-big-bang-theory-lawsuits-no-one-talks-about.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-biggest-the-big-bang-theory-lawsuits-no-one-talks-about.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./774361-the-rock-sexiest-person-alive.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./774361-the-rock-sexiest-person-alive.html>The Rock Named People Magazines Sexiest Person Alive, Rock Comments (Video), Tag Team Retur</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sevdije-kastrati-net-worth.html>Sevdije Kastrati Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sevdije-kastrati-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
