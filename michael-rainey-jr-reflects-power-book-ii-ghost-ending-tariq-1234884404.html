Blige) and Davis MacLean (Method Man), who played pivotal roles in Tariq St. Patrick’s life. Tariq, played by <a href=# id=auto-tag_michael-rainey-jr data-tag=michael-rainey-jr>Michael Rainey Jr.</a>, is the son of James and Tasha St. Patrick (Omari Hardwick and Naturi Naughton), who grew to become a kingpin right before our eyes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234741732>crime-drama show</a> picked up from its predecessor, Power, as Tariq grappled with killing his father and keeping his mother away from jail and out of harms way. Book II saw the young hustler not only enroll in college but also drug deal his way through to afford MacLean, who got him out of many jams. In the midst, Tariq also began working with Monet Tejada, all while trying to become his own man — someone not like his father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ptq3-310-071422-0696-a.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The third season left fans wondering what would happen to Tariq, as its last episode ended with all of his allies turning against him. The<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234877472> final season</a> sees Tariq try and “reconcile with his past to rise to the top of the food chain and become who he needs to be to protect those he loves most.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The franchise announced that the fourth season would be its last in March, as a fourth&nbsp;Power&nbsp;spinoff&nbsp;is currently in development. “While this marks the conclusion of one chapter, our commitment to the Power universe endures with more compelling storytelling on the horizon,” stated Kathryn Busby, President of Programming for STARZ.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Power‘s legacy was continued by Book II: Ghost,<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234864962> Book III: Raising Kanan</a> and <a href=# data-type=pmc-gallery data-id=1234779427>Book IV: Force.</a> Speaking to his chapter’s conclusion, Rainey Jr. reflected on his time with the series, claiming that it taught him a lot about “loyalty, principles and respect.” He also shared that having his own spin-off proved to himself that he “was ready.”<br></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In an interview with VIBE, the 23-year-old spoke on dominating his role on Power and Book II: Ghost and gave insight into what he would have liked to see his character become.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m lrv-u-text-align-center">—</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>VIBE: Do you think that there’s any other show that can top what you all did at Power and Power Book II: Ghost?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Michael Rainey Jr: I’m not going to sit here all humble; there’s not going to be another show that’s going to replicate what the Power universe did, and that’s just the facts. It’s going to be great shows out there. There’s going to be historic and legendary shows, but what Power did, I don’t think another show could replicate that.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Thinking back to when you first started until now, what have you learned about your own work ethic and capabilities?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">I learned a lot. Being around these great people every day, these great minds and even the scripts — the situations that characters go through with each other — it taught me a lot about loyalty, principles and respect. When they told me I was going to have my own spin-off, I was like, ‘Hell, no. Y’all bugging. That’s not going to happen. Nobody likes Tariq. It’s over with. That’s not going to happen.’ 50 [Cent] told me, ‘Yo, they don’t think that you ready.’ Then I was like ‘Oh no, they bugging.’</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">I had to get into a mode of not even trying to prove them wrong, but just proving me and 50 Cent right, because 50 knew I was ready. I’m like, ‘You know what? I got no choice but to be ready.’ I just took everything that was coming and I was just like, ‘Whatever happens, happens. We going to work, though.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ptq1-021520-jw1000-a.jpg><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Would you say you ultimately said yes to the spin-off because you had something to prove?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">No. I said yes because I had no choice. They’re like, ‘Yo, we writing a TV show about you.’ I’m not goin to say ‘no.’ I was ready to quarterback the whole thing. At first, I was like, ‘Nobody likes Tariq, so I don’t know if I’m ready. I don’t think that anybody’s even going to watch it.’ Courtney [Kemp] actually came to me second, because 50 told me first and I thought he was joking. Once Courtney told me that, I was like, ‘All right, man, let me get ready. Let me get ready.’</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>It’s the last season, it’s bittersweet. When you found out, where were you and how did you take it?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">I don’t even know. I was probably in the crib playing a game or something. <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234861162>It wasn’t on set though</a>. We finished filming before we knew it was going to be the last season. I don’t even know where I was. They told me and I was like, “Why?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>If this weren’t the final season, where would you like to see Tariq’s character go or become?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">I would’ve wanted to see him get up out the state or something. Go out the country for a little bit. Go enjoy the fruits of your labor. You over here, damn near dying almost every day and you can’t even enjoy whatever you’re working for. Tariq needed a little three-day trip to Miami. I wanted to see Tariq actually get a chance to not even be just a kid, but be a human. He always had something going on.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Do you think he would’ve became exactly like his father, or maybe taken the good guy path?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">I don’t think there was no good guy path for Tariq. It was there for him his whole life, and I just feel like he just went the route that was really meant for him. It’s like, how could he really become anything else? He didn’t have nothing else to look up to. He didn’t have nobody that was a college graduate that got their degree to look up to. His mentor was Kanan and running around with him from the whole third season. It’s like all of that stuff he learned from Kanan, what could he possibly apply that to, other than the streets?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ptq3-310-063022-0339-a.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>That makes sense.</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He’s just in the streets, and he’s just a product of his environment, product of his family.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Of the entire Power universe, who would you say was the number one villain and hero?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Dre is definitely the number one villain. That dude was alive for so long. He was raising hell forever. If you’re going to say ‘hero,’ there’s a few people you could really consider for certain reasons. I would consider Tariq a hero because he didn’t let Ghost send his mom to jail. Even though she ended up in jail anyway, it wasn’t for what she would’ve ended up in jail for. I would say Tasha’s also a hero, too, because she kind of saved Tariq.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Would you be a part of another 50 Cent production?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Oh yeah, 100%. Anything 50 doing and he call me for it, count me in. Anytime. That’s my idol. I’ll never pass up an <a href=# data-type=post data-id=454658>opportunity to work with 50 Cent </a>ever in my life, ever.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>What’s next for you?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A lot is next for Michael. Right now, I have a small writers team and we got two scripts right now that we’re writing, obviously auditioning — I’m going to be filming something very soon, can’t speak on that, but looking forward to it — and my music stuff I’ve been producing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ptq3-305-042222-0369-a.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m lrv-u-text-align-center">—</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Season four of the hit drama series will be&nbsp;split into two parts, with the first premiering on Friday (June 7) and the second on Sept. 6.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See the trailer above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6K2pLTAnqNmqpGeu6bFjKOpZqqVm7mmr9OsZKmnp5q%2Fbq7OqKJmoZlitKm70q1knqaUnruoedOaqaKpXWZ%2FdICXcWttaGRk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-rainey-jr-reflects-power-book-ii-ghost-ending-tariq-1234884404.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmichael-rainey-jr-reflects-power-book-ii-ghost-ending-tariq-1234884404.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmichael-rainey-jr-reflects-power-book-ii-ghost-ending-tariq-1234884404.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmichael-rainey-jr-reflects-power-book-ii-ghost-ending-tariq-1234884404.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-rainey-jr-reflects-power-book-ii-ghost-ending-tariq-1234884404.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-rainey-jr-reflects-power-book-ii-ghost-ending-tariq-1234884404.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./difference-between-wide-and-medium-shoes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./difference-between-wide-and-medium-shoes.html>Difference Between Wide And Medium Shoes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kevin-hart-net-worth.html>Kevin Hart Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kevin-hart-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
