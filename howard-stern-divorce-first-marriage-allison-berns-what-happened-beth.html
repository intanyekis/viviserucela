A deprived, partying-loving, women-addicted, slob. But anyone who actually listens to The Howard Stern Show knows that this is the furthest from the truth. Unlike celebrities who present themselves to be completely wholesome and turn out to be quite complicated, to say the least (ahem... ahem... <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a>), Howard is the opposite. Even during his most vulgar, crass, and downright hilarious, Howard wasn't the character that he pretended to be on the radio for laughs and ratings. In fact, he was a family man.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Howard Stern is in fact,<a href=#> a father to three daughters</a> from his first marriage which ended in the late 1990s. Their baby mama was supposed to be the love of Howard's life. He and Allison Berns met in college and lasted well into the height of Howard's fame (and infamy). But eventually, things imploded. For a couple of years, Howard was the bachelor that he played on his iconic radio show. Then he met and fell in love with <a href=#>his second wife, Beth</a>, the woman he's been with for upwards of twenty years. But what exactly happened after his divorce and between his two wives? Was he a player? Did he finally become the walking Freudian Id he played on the radio? Or was being single an utterly miserable experience for him?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-after-howard-stern-39-s-divorce-with-allison-berns>What Happened After Howard Stern's Divorce With Allison Berns</h2><p>There's no doubt that Howard Stern suffered after his first marriage imploded. It's the reason he started therapy and ultimately began to change both creatively and personally. He was afraid for his family and he was afraid that the image he created on the radio would overtake everything good in his life. But, Howard did get dragged out on the town after things with Allison ended. But he wasn't happy about it.</p><p>During numerous segments on The Howard Stern Show, the self-proclaimed King of All Media has been honest about his conflicting feelings about being single. While he loved the attention he was receiving from women, he just didn't feel comfortable being single. He is far more monogamous than meets the eye.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"After my divorce, I realized, 'Oh, wow, I can go have sex.' And I was running around, picking up women. Then all of a sudden, it dawned on me that I really didn’t need that much sex," <a href=#>Howard told Rolling Stone</a> during an interview in 2019 for his book, "Howard Stern Comes Again". "I just wanted somebody with me every minute. I was using women as a surrogate mother. When I tapped into that, it suddenly/became very childish behavior. And really, was it so great f**king every night? They’re using me for my fame, I’m using them for their beauty, and the whole thing seemed empty."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How A Howard Stern Employee Got Involved In His Marriage To Beth</a></span></p><h2 id=howard-stern-dated-robin-givens-not-robin-quivers>Howard Stern Dated Robin Givens... Not Robin Quivers</h2><p>Fans want to know if Howard ever dated his longtime co-host, Robin Quivers. Of course, they absolutely never had a thing. But Howard did date actor and model Robin Givens for a brief time in 1999 after his divorce. The two dated a notable time period and didn't just go on a few dates, according to Robin during an interview on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During that interview, she also famously stated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard was a "magnificent lover"</a> despite all of the radio host's self-deprecating jokes about his sex life.</p><h2 id=howard-hated-being-single-and-playing-the-field-but-he-did>Howard Hated Being Single And Playing The Field... But He Did</h2><p>Even though Howard Stern was single and between major relationships for just over a year, he did take some advantage of being famous and available. Aside from dating Robin Givens, Howard did hook up with a number of women after his divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It seemed more like a feeding frenzy than anything. I was in a frenzy. I had to grab everything and everyone. It was as if I was entitled to everything. I knew it was unhealthy: I’m not entitled to everything, I’m like everyone else," Howard said to Rolling Stone before claiming that he wasn't out of control like a Charlie Sheen, but he did like meeting women when he was out with his friends. Contrary to popular belief (and his antics on the show) women of the night weren't his thing because of his germaphobia.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Howard Stern's Wife Beth Turned Down 'Celebrity Big Brother'</a></span></p><p>"I’d been a faithful husband for 25 years, and I wasn’t the cheating type. And my marriage ending blew my mind. I was upset that I failed and let down my family, my kids, my ex-wife. It all was very painful. But as far as being with somebody new, it certainly wasn’t unpleasant. It was kind of exciting, but at some point, it became like I was on autopilot. I don’t know what I was doing: I wasn’t thinking of myself as a human being who valued myself," Howard added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But then he met Beth Ostrosky at a party and the two immediately connected. While things could have been a one-night stand, the two basically spent 72 hours together after their first meeting. They just couldn't get enough of each other. And while Howard vowed never to get married again, Beth eventually convinced him and they've been happily together ever since. Based on Howard's comments on his show, and the fact that he's barely left his house since the pandemic began, it doesn't seem as though he's willing to ever let another relationship break apart again. Certainly not the one he has built with Beth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Larry King Flirted With Beth Stern, According To Howard Stern</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK%2BRp7Fuv9OeqadllJ7DsL7CnmSfoaKowW65wKupopmXmnqiuMuiqqimXZeys7rSZq6hmaRitaK8z56lnpxdl7K1tI4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhoward-stern-divorce-first-marriage-allison-berns-what-happened-beth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhoward-stern-divorce-first-marriage-allison-berns-what-happened-beth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhoward-stern-divorce-first-marriage-allison-berns-what-happened-beth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhoward-stern-divorce-first-marriage-allison-berns-what-happened-beth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhoward-stern-divorce-first-marriage-allison-berns-what-happened-beth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhoward-stern-divorce-first-marriage-allison-berns-what-happened-beth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tony-bennett-dead-celebrities-react-after-musicians-death.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tony-bennett-dead-celebrities-react-after-musicians-death.html>Tony Bennett Dead: Celebrities React After Musician's Death</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tatyana-ali-pictures-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-photos.html>See The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air Star Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tatyana-ali-pictures-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
