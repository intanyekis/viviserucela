He just would get a different look on his face, and he talked about it so nonchalantly, like going down to get a cup of coffee,” Cadle recalled of an in-person meeting.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Frank Rzucek (left), the father of Shan’ann Watts, and her brother, Frankie Rzucek, at Watts’ arraignment on Aug. 21, 2018. <span class=credit>Denver Post via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Watts and Cadle had at least one three-hour “contact” visit after initially corresponding, a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2020 WDOC report</a> obtained by Inside Edition shows.</p><p>More recently, Watts is said to have grown close to Dylan Tallman, a fellow Dodge inmate who insists Watts is innocent, the outlet reported — adding that both men became religious behind bars and jointly self-published a prayer book titled “Revelation in the Reckoning” in 2021.</p><p>“My past is a blueprint and the devil the architect. While I watch his fallen ones build stone upon stone every day I see these walls as insurmountable, a barrier that blocks me from enjoying your love, your peace, and of your joy, oh Lord,” one prayer allegedly reads.</p><p>“You are my master builder. Help me walk around these walls, sound the trumpet and shout that they may come crashing down like the walls of Jericho.”</p><p>Religion is a crucial part of Watts’ “healing process,” the 2020 WDOC report stated, according to the outlet.</p><p>“In regards to his feelings towards the victims, he just kind of renewed his faith and talks to the victims through prayer,” it said.</p><p>Watts was arrested on Aug. 15, 2018 — two days after Shan’ann, Bella, and Cece were reported missing from the family’s Frederick, Colo., home.</p><p>Though he initially denied he was involved in the disappearance of his wife and daughters, Watts eventually confessed to strangling Shan’ann — who was 15 weeks pregnant — in the early hours of Aug. 13, 2018.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Shan’ann Watts’ mother, Sandra Rzucek, at Watts’ sentencing hearing. <span class=credit>Denver Post via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Watts initially said Shan’ann killed their daughters in a rage after he asked for a separation, but eventually confessed to smothering the little girls with blankets after driving them and his wife’s body to the Anadarko Petroleum plant where he worked.</p><p>Shan’ann’s body was subsequently found in a shallow grave on the oil field; the remains of Bella and Cece were recovered from crude oil storage tanks.</p><p>Autopsies revealed both little girls had oil, water, and sludge in their stomachs.</p><p>Watts avoided the death penalty by pleading guilty to the murders of Shan’ann, Bella, and Cece, and the unlawful termination of their unborn son, Nico, on Nov. 6, 2018.</p><p>He is serving five life sentences at Dodge <a href=#>after being transferred from a Colorado facility</a> in December 2018 because of security concerns.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fmam9fm66utcuyZKShnKGys3nCoamiq12srrXA0magrGWgp7a0u81mmq6rpKSxqq3NZp%2Baq12bsq6ty55kqZ2eYr2iuNJo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffamily-killer-chris-watts-is-prison-custodian-has-female-pen-pals.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffamily-killer-chris-watts-is-prison-custodian-has-female-pen-pals.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffamily-killer-chris-watts-is-prison-custodian-has-female-pen-pals.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffamily-killer-chris-watts-is-prison-custodian-has-female-pen-pals.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffamily-killer-chris-watts-is-prison-custodian-has-female-pen-pals.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffamily-killer-chris-watts-is-prison-custodian-has-female-pen-pals.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./howie-dorough-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./howie-dorough-net-worth.html>Howie Dorough Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./danni-baird-biography.html>Danni Baird Bio (Wiki)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./danni-baird-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
