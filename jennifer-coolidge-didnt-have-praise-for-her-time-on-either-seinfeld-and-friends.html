Then there's her quirky character in Two Broke Girls, as well as notable appearances on <strong><a href=#>Friends</a> </strong>and <strong><a href=#>Seinfeld</a></strong>, which weren't as fun as they seemed.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/the-real-reason-meghann-and-leo-woodall-keep-their-alleged-relationship-a-secret-after-meeting-on-white-lotus-season-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Real Reason Meghann Fahy And Leo Woodall Keep Their Alleged Relationship A Secret After Meeting On White Lotus Season 2</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Meghann Fahy and Leo Woodall have admitted to being friends, but fans still think there's more going on between them...</span><h2 id=jennifer-coolidge-had-an-quot-intimidating-quot-experience-on-friends>Jennifer Coolidge Had An "Intimidating" Experience On Friends<img alt="Jennifer Coolidge on the Friends set in a white jacket" data-image-id=207483 height=628 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jennifer-Coolidge-on-Friends.png width=1200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h2><p>Coolidge previously shared that her creative input was unheard when she played Amanda Buffamonteezi as a guest star on Friends. "Sometimes I think people want to hear my ad-libs when I get on a show, and they really don't," she said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">per our previous report</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Sometimes I come in and throw some lines, and they come up and say, 'You know, Jennifer, we're just going to stick to the script.' That was a serious show," she continued. The A Cinderella Story alum then opened up about feeling intimidated on the set of the show.</p><p>"The vibe was pretty serious," she recalled despite being friends with Lisa Kudrow. "I don’t think they wanted my input, and I could really feel that…sticking to their own stuff. So I didn't have the guts [to push]." As a result, Coolidge spent most of her time in her dressing room.</p><p>"I have to say, I was kind of intimidated, even though I knew Lisa because she was in a comedy group," the actress remembered. "But I didn't know the rest of them, and I was very intimidated because they were all so attractive and had it going on. I'm just going to do my little part and I'll be in my dressing room."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for her lack of improv autonomy, she said: "The only thing I improvised was they wanted me to dance awkwardly, so I felt like I had a natural ability to dance that way. I think that was the only time they didn’t give me direction; they wanted me to say the lines and call it a day."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jennifer-Coolidge-on-Friends.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jennifer Coolidge Has Her Own Pick For The Next James Bond</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>After working with one specific actor, Jennifer Coolidge labeled him a funny James Bond.</span><h2 id=jennifer-coolidge-lied-to-get-her-role-on-seinfeld>Jennifer Coolidge Lied To Get Her Role On Seinfeld</h2><h2><img alt="Jennifer Coolidge on the red carpet" data-image-id=239167 height=628 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar52657947-1.jpg width=1200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h2><p>In 1993, Coolidge landed a part on Seinfeld. But to get in, she lied about her then-nonexistent acting experience. "It was a weird day," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told GQ</a>. "I booked Seinfeld the same day that I booked this very short-lived series called She TV, which was an all-women sketch show on ABC. I didn't really have any jobs before that. I only had lies on my resume."</p><p>She continued: "I'd gone to a school called American Academy of Dramatic Arts up in Pasadena, and I'd just named all these shows and all these different theaters at the school as if they played there. You have to do that if you have a blank resume, until you start getting jobs. Then you can slowly erase the lies. I'd love to get my hands on that resume now."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She was so excited about her Seinfeld audition that she broadcasted it in a clothing store back then. "'I'm auditioning for Seinfeld tomorrow,' And they were like, 'Oh, honey, you've got to wear better clothes than what you're wearing,'" she recounted. "So they made me buy this little outfit, and I think it got me the job! I kind of looked clueless most of the time, and these girls put me together."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/untitled-design-2-1.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Where You May Have Seen The Cast Of The White Lotus Before</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>From Jake Lacy to Brittney O'Grady, Sydney Sweeney, and more, here's where you may have seen the cast of The White Lotus before.</span><h2 id=jennifer-coolidge-nearly-turned-down-the-white-lotus>Jennifer Coolidge Nearly Turned Down The White Lotus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar52657947-1.jpg><p>When <a href=#>director Mike White</a> offered Coolidge her role in The White Lotus, she was going through lockdown blues and was conscious about her weight. A "really smart, savvy, very blunt friend" ended up encouraging her to do the project. "I didn't like the way I looked," she said of that time. "But did I change it for The White Lotus 2? No! I didn't change anything!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>White was also persistent in getting Coolidge for his Emmy-winning drama. "There's times where she disappears, and you're like, 'Is there meaning behind this or is this just her?'" he said of dealing with the actress. "But there was just no way she was ever going to say no, because I would have forced her by her hair. The reason I was doing this was to do it with her."</p><p>During her acceptance speech for her Golden Globe for Best Performance By An Actress In A Supporting Role In A Limited Series, Coolidge thanked White, saying: "You've given me a new beginning. Even if this is the end, because you did kill me off, but it doesn't matter."</p><p>"Even if this is the end, you changed my life in a million different ways," she said in reference to <a href=#>her character's tragic fate in the second season</a>. "My neighbors are speaking to me and things like that. I mean it. I was never invited to one party on my hill, and now everyone’s inviting me. I just – you know, it's to you, Mike White."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoycpqikmZm0pnnDopunrF2drrexjKmpmqGjmnqnu9Fmn56qXam2rrGMqKVmnZmptaa%2BjKycoqaWmrmlecCnm2aeop6yr7DSaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjennifer-coolidge-didnt-have-praise-for-her-time-on-either-seinfeld-and-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjennifer-coolidge-didnt-have-praise-for-her-time-on-either-seinfeld-and-friends.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjennifer-coolidge-didnt-have-praise-for-her-time-on-either-seinfeld-and-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjennifer-coolidge-didnt-have-praise-for-her-time-on-either-seinfeld-and-friends.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjennifer-coolidge-didnt-have-praise-for-her-time-on-either-seinfeld-and-friends.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-coolidge-didnt-have-praise-for-her-time-on-either-seinfeld-and-friends.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./madison-beer-praises-olivia-rodrigos-vampire-zack-bia-connection.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./madison-beer-praises-olivia-rodrigos-vampire-zack-bia-connection.html>Madison Beer Praises Olivia Rodrigo's 'Vampire': Zack Bia Connection</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./inside-justin-bieber-friends-in-las-vegas-concerts-hotel.html>Inside Justin Bieber &amp;amp; Friends in Las Vegas: Concerts, Hotel</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./inside-justin-bieber-friends-in-las-vegas-concerts-hotel.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
