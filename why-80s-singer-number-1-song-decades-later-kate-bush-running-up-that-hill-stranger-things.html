"Running Up That Hill," taken from Kate Bush's Hounds Of Love album, has climbed up the charts after being featured in the fourth season of the hit <strong><a href=#>Netflix </a></strong>series Stranger Things. The song itself has actually been played throughout the sci-fi season, but many people may remember it from one particularly epic and emotional scene featuring Sadie Sink's character Max Mayfield.This isn’t Kate Bush’s first taste of success: the veteran singer/songwriter has been nominated for Brits, Grammy Awards and Billboard Music Awards over her 40-year career, and her song was even used in the 2012 London Olympics. So, why has this legendary 63-year-old English singer-songwriter had such a successful comeback, despite not releasing a new album or single?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kate-bush-s-song-was-featured-on-stranger-things><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Kate Bush's Song Was Featured On Stranger Things</span></h2><p>Kate Bush’s emotionally stirring ballad was incorporated as an important component <a href=#>in the hit Netflix sci-fi show’s fourth season’s storyline.</a></p><p>The song helps Max (played by Sadie Sink) escape the horrifying clutches of the villain, Vecna.

Because "Running Up That Hill" talks about making a deal with God, people often misinterpret it.</p><p>"I was trying to say that, really, a man and a woman can't understand each other because we are a man and a woman. And if we could actually swap each other's roles, if we could actually be in each other's place for a while, I think we'd both be very surprised!" Kate Bush once explained. "And really the only way I could think it could be done was either... you know, I thought a deal with the devil, you know. And I thought, 'well, no, why not a deal with God!' You know, because in a way it's so much more powerful the whole idea of asking God to make a deal with you."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The song was originally hugely controversial and even banned in countries where it is now number 1.

Ireland wouldn't play it, and that generally we might get it blocked purely because it had God in the title."</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-kate-bush><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Happened To Kate Bush?</span></h2><p>The once-popular singer now favors a life out of the limelight.
