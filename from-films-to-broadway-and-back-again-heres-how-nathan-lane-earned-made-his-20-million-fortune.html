With a net worth of $20 million, the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">comedian and performer</a> has more than 80 credits in film and television and that doesn’t begin to cover the huge success the three-time Tony award winner has seen throughout his career.</p><p>Take a look back at the twists and turns of a comedian’s career that earned him millions in the process.</p><h2 id=always-a-performer>Always A Performer</h2><p>Nathan Lane (born Joseph Lane) grew up in a <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Catholic household</a> with two older brothers, attending St. Peter’s Preparatory School.
