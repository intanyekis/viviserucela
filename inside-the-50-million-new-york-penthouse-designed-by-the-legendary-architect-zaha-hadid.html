She is best known to design commercial properties such as the London Aquatics Center, National Museum of 21st Century Art, and One Thousand Museum. The <a href=#>Pritzker Prize-winning architect designed</a> a residential complex in New York at 520 West 28th Street. The building is the first completed architectural project of the Zaha Hadid <a href=#>Architecture in New York</a>. While there is a price cut in the penthouse market in New York, the Hadid-designed complex is one of the most coveted properties in the area. It is a unique opportunity to own a home in the last residential project created by the late architect.</p><p>Offering soaring views of the city of New York and designed with a combination of sleek interior and modern architecture, the New York penthouse is a sculptural masterpiece. Let’s take a look inside the gorgeous $50 million penthouse designed by Zaha Hadid.</p><h2 id=views-from-every-direction>Views From Every Direction</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The triplex penthouse called the Penthouse 37 is located on the top floors of the 39-unit building near the High Line Park in West Chelsea, New York. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mansion Global</a>, the home has a 6,853 sq. ft. of area and five luxury bedrooms. The apartment is open from three directions: North, South, and East, and has a private elevator that directly opens into the residence for optimum privacy of the occupants.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Peek Inside David Beckham's $20 Million Miami Penthouse With A Helipad</a></span></p><p>The Lower Level features the Master Suite that comes with a full dressing room, dual bathrooms, and a spacious private balcony. The same floor also has three separate bedrooms that feature ensuite bathrooms. On the Mid Floor, there is an Entertainment Section that has a powder room for guests and a library. It also has a Break Room that spans across 1,250 sq. ft. that has a fireplace and a private balcony, while the fifth bedroom is located adjacent to the walk-in kitchen. <a href=#>The home is designed</a> with utmost precision and fluid interior concepts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=an-interior-with-an-aesthetic-journey>An Interior With An Aesthetic Journey</h2><p>The eat-in kitchen was made in collaboration with luxury Italian kitchen furnishing company Boffi and features high-end appliances from the Gaggenau collection. As each home in the building is designed with handcrafted millwork, the penthouse is no different. The home is framed by 11-foot floor-to-ceiling windows everywhere. In contrast, the home's centerpiece is a three-story dramatic, sculptural staircase designed by Hadid herself, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a>. The staircase connects the three Levels of the penthouse and the outdoor terrace.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The spiral staircase is an evolutionary piece of modern architecture that uses similar concepts as Zaha Hadid did with her commercial buildings. The staircase offers multiple perspectives for people to perceive between the horizontal and vertical lines of the building. It captures the essence of unity as it binds the penthouse with a fluid design reflecting its exterior design. Hadid, known as the Queen Of The Curve, put her mark on the penthouse with the standout staircase.</p><p>The interior features extensive wooden flooring and muted hues for the walls. The home also features a 2,552 sq. ft. of private outdoor space for a day in the sun. Located on the Top-Level Level, it also has a dining area, lounge, an outdoor kitchen for barbecue meals, and multiple sunbathing beds. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Galerie Magazine</a>, including the private lift that brings residents straight into the home, the penthouse also has an indoor lift that can be used instead of the staircase.</p><h2 id=luxury-service-for-residents>Luxury Service For Residents</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only is <a href=#>the home stacked with amenities</a>, but the apartment building also offers services for every need. The residential building has a valet service that is on call at all times, a private automated storage facility, a 75-foot sky-lit pool on the top floor, a fitness and wellness center, and an IMAX theatre. Upon reservation, the wellness center also offers the spa suite, a plunge pool, treatment beds, steam rooms, rain showers, and many other amenities.</p><p>The boutique building designed by Hadid has many celebrities like Ariana Grande and Sting, who already reside there. While the penthouse was designed and put on sale for $50 million, within three years, the price was cut down to $20 million through negotiations. Wes Edens, the co-founder of Fortress Investment Group, purchased the home in 2020, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Post</a>. The penthouse saw a 60% discount since the market has been volatile after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A home created for billionaires, the Zaha Hadid-designed property is only one of the two residential projects. Her other project is called One Thousand Museum, located in Miami, Florida. Hadid has made her imprints on the building and the penthouse with her signature style and elegant concepts that will remind her legacy in the field of modern architecture.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Hilfiger Touch: Inside Tommy Hilfiger’s $50 Million Plaza Hotel Penthouse</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mansion Global</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Galerie Magazine</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Post</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS2r7%2FInZxmrJiaenZ8jKagpaSZpLtuusSwZLKnoqB6sbHNrZ%2BoraOaeqWx0qKep52UYq%2B6edOhnGaklZyyr7DAq7BmmaKYtarAxJyrZrKRna5utMCdoJ1n</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-the-50-million-new-york-penthouse-designed-by-the-legendary-architect-zaha-hadid.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-the-50-million-new-york-penthouse-designed-by-the-legendary-architect-zaha-hadid.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-the-50-million-new-york-penthouse-designed-by-the-legendary-architect-zaha-hadid.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-the-50-million-new-york-penthouse-designed-by-the-legendary-architect-zaha-hadid.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-the-50-million-new-york-penthouse-designed-by-the-legendary-architect-zaha-hadid.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-the-50-million-new-york-penthouse-designed-by-the-legendary-architect-zaha-hadid.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./middleton-family-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./middleton-family-net-worth.html>Kate Middleton's Family Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./geena-davis-fiance-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-measurements.html>Geena Davis: Fianc, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body measurements</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./geena-davis-fiance-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-measurements.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
