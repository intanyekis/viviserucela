Their song&nbsp;“The Breaker,” went in the top of the country charts.</p><p>They have gained the name for&nbsp;combining four unique voices into one distinct harmony. More than their music, the bond which all they carry together is a more precious thing.</p><p>During the interview with&nbsp;CBS News correspondent Jan Crawford, Karen explained:</p><p>“We’re family. We’ve, like, experienced the greatest highs and the most horrible lows. And we’ve always been together.”</p><p>Though they are now in the&nbsp;highs with all the hit songs and the honors, they started from all the way down. Karen explained:</p><p>“We looked at each other at a certain point. It’s, like, we’re just gonna keep showin’ up and keep out-workin’ everybody. If that’s what we have to do, then we’ll do it.&nbsp;We never talked about quitting.”</p><p>The group has gone through many up and down throughout their career.
