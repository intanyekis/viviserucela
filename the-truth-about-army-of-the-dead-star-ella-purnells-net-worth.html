With two new shows on her horizon, Yellowjackets and Army of the Dead: Lost Vegas, chances are she's setting herself up for a massive Hollywood career. Of course, much of this is due to her presence in Zack Snyder's Army of the Dead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Army of the Dead got a lot of press for <a href=#>Chris Delia's controversial dismissal</a> and Dave Bautista's <a href=#>choice to do the movie instead of The Suicide Squad</a>, it was deeply important to many of the project's stars. Perhaps to Ella most of all. Because of the <a href=#>Netflix</a> film, Ella's fan following increased exponentially. And like with most celebrities, Ella's fans are wondering about both her personal life and her financial life...</p><h2 id=how-ella-made-her-2-3-million-net-worth>How Ella Made Her $2.3 Million Net Worth</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Celebs Week</a>, Ella Purnell is worth an impressive $2.3 million. That's pretty amazing given the fact that she's only 24 years old. Ella started her career on the London stage, acting in plays such as Oliver!, which she beat out hundreds of other young actors to get. Soon after, the England-born beauty got a role in the film Never Let Me Go where she played the younger version of Keira Knightley's character. Shortly after her big 2010 movie debut, Ella was cast in Gustavo Rob's Ways To Live, Intruders, Kick Ass 2, and in Maleficent, where she played the younger version of Angelina Jolie's titular Disney character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All of this caused many notable British and American publications to name her " a rising star to watch".</p><p>In 2016, director Tim Burton hired Ella in one of the leading roles in Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children. While this movie may not rank among <a href=#>Tim's best films</a>, it certainly opened up the door for much bigger projects and allowed Ella to rake in some serious dough for her role as Emma.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tim Burton Wanted Nothing To Do With This $100,000 Prop In The 1989 'Batman'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon after, Ella was cast as Winston Churchill's secretary in Brain Cox's Churchill and won a role on the acclaimed British mini-series Ordeal By Innocence. Around the same time, Ella auditioned for the leading role in the Starz series Sweetbitter. Deadline announced her casting in 2017. The show lasted for two seasons and really put a spotlight on the array of emotions and perspectives Ella has to offer. Not only could she play the pretty girl next door, but also someone with somewhat ruthless ambition and true heart. Despite the series, which was based on Stephanie Danler's book of the same name, being loved by its fanbase, it simply didn't garner enough attention to warrant a third season.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Nicole Scherzinger Actually Made Her $14 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>While Ella must have taken the news hard, there's no doubt that she soon found her stride again as she was cast in<a href=#> Zack Synder and Netflix's Army of the Dead</a>. Her role as the headstrong daughter of Dave Bautista's lead character has catapulted her into all-new levels of fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only has she joined the cast of the star-studded Yellowjackets, currently filming in Vancouver, British Columbia, but she will be reprising her Army of the Dead character in a leading role in the TV spin-off, Army of the Dead: Lost Vegas.</p><h2 id=ella-39-s-personal-life>Ella's Personal Life</h2><p>There's been quite a bit of talk about Ella Purnell's personal life despite her relatively new rise in Hollywood. This tends to happen with a lot of young, beautiful stars like Ella. The press gets extremely nosey and even starts creating stories about her. Of course, some of the rumors circulating about Ella's romantic life may have some legitimacy. This includes <a href=#>sneaking out of a BAFTA party with Tom Holland </a>and even a brief romantic encounter with the much older Brad Pitt. The latter, however, doesn't seem to have as much photo evidence of the previous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Think Shakira Spends Too Much Of Her Net Worth, Here's Why</a></span></p><p>On top of this, Ella has been linked to her Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children co-star, Asa Butterfield, as well as James Coates. According to her Instagram, Ella was dating and living with Riverdale star Rob Raco and news sources claim that the two are still together. However, a look at both of their Instagrams proves that they have gone their separate ways. Currently, Ella is shooting Yellowjackets with an all-star cast in Vancouver while Rob seems to be in a new relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite all the boyfriend rumors, Ella seems to be living her best life with her friends, traveling across the west coast of Canada. Even though she's busy shooting Yellowjackets in Vancouver, Ella has been taking her girlfriends on trips to Vancouver Island, going on hikes, having days at the beach, and going out to the city's swankiest restaurants. While she's certainly adding to her net worth with all of these new series, her impressive career leading up to this point has clearly afforded her a pretty fun lifestyle.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's How Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Is Adding To Her $30 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6or7MsmSonl2ptaZ5w56YnWWjqa6zecSlo5ploKq%2Fr7HLpapmppWperi70a2fZmc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-truth-about-army-of-the-dead-star-ella-purnells-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-truth-about-army-of-the-dead-star-ella-purnells-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-truth-about-army-of-the-dead-star-ella-purnells-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-truth-about-army-of-the-dead-star-ella-purnells-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-truth-about-army-of-the-dead-star-ella-purnells-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-army-of-the-dead-star-ella-purnells-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./vijay-sethupathi.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./vijay-sethupathi.html>Vijay Sethupathi Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Family, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./see-hayley-erbert-return-to-tour-with-derek-hough-after-brain-surgery.html>See Hayley Erbert Return to Tour With Derek Hough After Brain Surgery</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./see-hayley-erbert-return-to-tour-with-derek-hough-after-brain-surgery.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
