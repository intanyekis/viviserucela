But it appeared that that particular storyline had run its course when Ross was asked by Rachel to take her boss's niece, Emily to the theater. The two began dating, fell in love, and, albeit only for a short time, got married. The problem with the relationship between Ross and Emily was that <strong><a href=#>David Schwimmer</a></strong> and Helen Baxendale did not have the same fun, flirty chemistry that Schwimmer and <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong>, <a href=#>who had things in common with her character</a>, had. As such, not only did fans have a hard time rooting for the relationship to last, but the creators of the show did as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston Never Liked The "Rachel" Haircut, Even Though Fans Imitated It</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Conversations were had about what to do to salvage the relationship between Ross and Emily. There was even a discussion about firing Baxendale and recasting the role of Emily, <a href=#>even though the cast had nothing bad to say about her</a>. In the end though, creator, James Burrows let the storyline play out and never brought Baxendale back to guest star in the years after Emily and Ross divorced.</p><h2 id=james-burrows-almost-fired-helen-baxendale-from-39-friends-39>James Burrows Almost Fired Helen Baxendale From 'Friends'</h2><p>Baxendale was on a total of 14 episodes of Friends, which was enough time for her to become fodder for the paparazzi and <a href=#>struggle with the fame she received being on such a high-profile show</a>.</p><p>Her relationship blossomed with Ross in Season Four and by Season Five, the two were married. But that did not mean that Baxendale had a secure job on the show.</p><p>Quite the contrary, in fact, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Burrows almost fired her from the show</a>. However, as a result of scheduling, that idea was eventually taken off the table.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar45979653-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Often, you can’t recast, because of tight shooting deadlines or other logistical considerations," Burrows wrote in his book, Directed By James Burrows. "You need someone who gets laughs. Sometimes you start an arc and it ain’t working out, so you have to get rid of that person. If it’s a day player, it’s a quick goodbye."</p><p>However, with the tight deadlines and shooting schedule Friends had, it was nearly impossible to be able to recast the role of Emily in the timeframe they had. Instead, the decision was made to write the character off the show and use her as little as possible to move the storyline along.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Scene With David Schwimmer And Jennifer Aniston On Friends Turned Into A Nightmare For Matt LeBlanc</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This did not mean that Baxendale was not a good actor. What it meant was that if there was going to be a character that was going to take Ross' attention and love away from Rachel, there needed to be a significant amount of chemistry between the actors portraying those roles.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is something that Schwimmer and Baxendale did not have.</p><h2 id=chemistry-between-ross-and-emily-wasn-39-t-the-same-as-ross-and-rachel>Chemistry Between Ross And Emily Wasn't The Same As Ross And Rachel</h2><p>While Ross had a series of relationships over the course of the series, none of them ultimately made him happy because he was in love with Rachel.</p><p>However, that did not mean that there were not some great romantic interests on Friends where there was chemistry between Schwimmer and the actor playing his current crush, such as Bonnie Summerville (Mona), Aisha Tyler (Charlie), Christine Taylor (Bonnie), and others. The same, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">could not be said for Schwimmer and Baxendale</a> and their on-screen chemistry.</p><p>"Schwimmer had no one to bounce off," Burrows explained in his memoir. "It was like clapping with one hand."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/friends-emily-ross.jpg><p>Burrows went on, saying, "In sitcoms and any type of romantic comedy, the funny is just as important as the chemistry. We discovered that any new girlfriend for Ross needed to be as funny as Rachel... If there’s chemistry, the writers go to work to figure out some way of keeping the actor."</p><p>That meant that anyone brought on the show not only needed to have chemistry with Schwimmer that was as good or better than it was with Aniston but also needed to be funny to resonate with the audience and make the relationship believable.</p><p>The character of Emily was not seen as particularly funny by fans and even divided them when it came to her behavior after the wedding when Ross said Rachel's name versus Emily's when saying his wedding vows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some found her to be too controlling by telling Ross that he could not have a friendship with Rachel. Others found Emily to be very forgiving given what took place at the wedding.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Adam Sandler Really Miss Out On Friends With Jennifer Aniston Because Of David Schwimmer's Height?</a></span></p><p>It was clear, however, that Baxendale had an expiration date on Friends. A fact that boiled down to her comedic timing and not her personality and how she got along with the cast.</p><h2 id=james-burrows-said-helen-baxendale-was-quot-nice-quot-but-quot-not-particularly-funny-quot>James Burrows Said Helen Baxendale Was "Nice" But "Not Particularly Funny"</h2><p>What was interesting about Baxendale's casting in Friends was that she did not come from a comedic background. Instead, Baxendale's resume is filled with more dramatic roles. Therefore, the fact that she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not found to be as funny as the other guest stars or permanent actors on the show</a> should not have been surprising.</p><p>"She was nice but not particularly funny," Burrows wrote of Baxendale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/helen-baxendale.jpg><p>To Baxendale's credit, Burrows only directed 15 episodes of Friends. Of those episodes, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">only one was with Baxendale.</a> As such, critics argue that he may not have truly gotten to see all that Emily's character could bring to the ensemble in that short time.</p><p>Critics have also said that Emily was not written in the same comedic light as the Friends cast was. Instead, Emily was "intended to be a wholesome, sensible and cultured figure." A character with these personality traits may not possess the same sense of humor as other characters on the show. However, Emily and Ross on paper looked to be a good match.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Between Burrow's believing there was a lack of chemistry between Emily and Ross, audiences not being able to build a relationship with Emily, and Baxendale getting pregnant during her stint on Friends, a long-term role on the show was not meant to be.</p><p>Perhaps, had circumstances been different, Baxendale could have prolonged her time on the show. But in the end, there was only one "lobster" for Ross and that was Rachel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq6GVo7G0ecCcq6iqXZa5rrvSrWSfoaKasW66zq1kmqtdm8KvuthmmKxlmpq7r7XFnqlmmZ6ewLW7zWg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffriends-actor-almost-fired-not-as-funny-as-jennifer-aniston.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffriends-actor-almost-fired-not-as-funny-as-jennifer-aniston.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffriends-actor-almost-fired-not-as-funny-as-jennifer-aniston.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffriends-actor-almost-fired-not-as-funny-as-jennifer-aniston.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffriends-actor-almost-fired-not-as-funny-as-jennifer-aniston.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffriends-actor-almost-fired-not-as-funny-as-jennifer-aniston.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./are-sza-and-lizzo-related-family-tree-and-net-worth-difference.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./are-sza-and-lizzo-related-family-tree-and-net-worth-difference.html>Are SZA And Lizzo Related, Family Tree And Net Worth Difference</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./taylor-net-worth.html>Taylor Net Worth How Much is Taylor Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./taylor-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
